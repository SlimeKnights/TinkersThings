# [Tinkers' Things](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-things-json)
Tinkers' Things is an addon for [Tinkers' Construct](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-construct) that contains no Java code (if you do not believe me, check the GitHub source). This is made possible through the mod [Json Things](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/json-things), which allows you do add custom items, fluids, blocks, creative tabs, and harvest tiers through JSON files.

This mod serves two purposes:
* It is a fully playable survival friendly Tinkers' Construct addon adding a lot of new tools and armor to the mod.
* It serves as an example for those wishing to create Tinkers' Construct datapacks and no-Java code addons.

## Playable Addon

This addon adds many features, including

* Chisels
* Shovels
* Halberds
* Blowpipes
* Shortbows
* Hematite tool material
* Large Repair Kits

For more info, check the image descriptions on the gallery tab.

It also includes examples of resource pack features:
